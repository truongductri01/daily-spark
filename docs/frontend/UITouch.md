# UI Issues - RESOLVED ✅

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Toast Notification Width ✅
**Problem**: The Toast notification was too narrow and didn't respect the content width, making text content hard to read.

**Solution**: 
- Changed from `max-w-sm w-full` to `min-w-sm w-auto` to allow content-based width
- Added `max-w-md` to the container to prevent excessive width on large screens
- Added `break-words` to text elements for better text wrapping
- Increased margin between icon and content from `ml-3` to `ml-4`
- Increased margin between title and message from `mt-1` to `mt-2`

**Files Modified**: `daily-spark-ui/src/components/Toast.tsx`

### 2. Back Button Styling ✅
**Problem**: Create New Curriculum or Edit Curriculum pages had back buttons with minimal styling that were too close to the main content and not visually distinct.

**Solution**:
- Added proper padding (`px-4 py-2`)
- Added border styling (`border border-spark-gray-300 hover:border-spark-blue-300`)
- Added background hover effect (`hover:bg-spark-blue-50`)
- Added shadow effects (`shadow-sm hover:shadow-md`)
- Added rounded corners (`rounded-lg`)
- Improved text styling (`font-medium text-sm`)
- Increased spacing between back button and main content (`space-x-6` instead of `space-x-4`)
- Enhanced hover transitions (`transition-all duration-200`)

**Files Modified**:
- `daily-spark-ui/src/pages/CurriculumEditPage.tsx`
- `daily-spark-ui/src/pages/CurriculumUploadPage.tsx`
- `daily-spark-ui/src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx`

## Summary
All UI issues have been resolved with improved content width handling, better visual hierarchy, and enhanced user experience. The toast notifications now properly respect content width for better readability, and back buttons are more prominent and visually distinct from the main content.
